# Social Media Tattoo Flutter App

The main idea of this application is to build a virtual place where people who are interested in the tattoo art can meet each other, exchange opinions, demonstrate their work on tattooing, view the work of others and find the best tatto artist that fit their needs. 

In the app you can search and follow profiles, like, save and comment on photos and leave reviews. <br>

This project was made for a Diploma Thesis. It mostly demonstrates the frontend and UI part of the main idea of the application written in a clean way and with clean architecture using BLoC.
